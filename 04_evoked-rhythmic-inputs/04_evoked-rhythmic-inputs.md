## Exogenous Driving Inputs: Evoked and Rhythmic ##

### Proximal vs. Distal Inputs ###
At rest, the default model does not generate activity. Instead, we use exogenous inputs to drive network dynamics. We use the terms proximal and distal to refer both to the origin of the inputs as well as the laminar target within the neocortical microcircuit. Proximal inputs refers to inputs arriving from lemniscal thalamus, which primarily target the granular and infragranular layers while distal inputs arrive from non-lemniscal thalamus and cortico-cortical feedback, which primarily target the supragranular layers. These differences are illustrated below.
