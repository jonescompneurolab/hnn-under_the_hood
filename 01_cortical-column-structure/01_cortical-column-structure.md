## Overview of Cortical Column Structure ##

Neocortical circuits are organized with remarkably similar features across areas and species. These features include a common laminar structure with generalizable cell classes as well as similar local connectivity and input and output connectivity patterns. We have harnessed this generalization into HNNâ€™s foundational neural model that is provided as a template circuit to work with.
